# codewars

My attempts and/or solutions to ruby-based codewars and other coding puzzles.

**SPOILER ALERT**
Don't let this spoil the fun of solving things yourself.

This repo is mainly for my own reference. Feel free to have a browse. The beauty of coding is that there are often a bunch of different ways to solve the same problem!

After venturing outside of codewars, I've now changed the set-up to use RSpec so that I can play and test the solutions. I may backfill for fun, otherwise forgive me.  

## Set-up

Clone file into directory
`git clone [key]`

Install bundler
`gem install bundler`

Install gems
`bundle install`
